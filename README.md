# Cookies-stealer-extension
JS extension that will steal cookies from users browser and will send it through discord webhook

**Add your discord webhook in the first line of "Background.js" file. Make sure that webhook is between ""**

PS: This will only work on google Chrome if you want to use it for any other browser you have to change the code and use that browser's API

Feel free to update it and if you have any issue hit me up here or on discord "L   O   W   K   E   Y |  KREEPY#2635"

**Don't use it for illegal purpose, its only for educational purpose**
